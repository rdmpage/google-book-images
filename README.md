# Google Books images

Notes on how to achieve small image size like Google Books. For background read:

## Requirements

Use [jbig2enc](https://github.com/agl/jbig2enc) to compress images (and also convert them to B&W). This library in turn depends on [leptonica](http://leptonica.com). Note that on macOS Sierra leptonica wouldnâ€™t compile as it complained about a missing variable Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION. Installing [zlib](http://zlib.net) and adding:
 
```
#include "zlib.h"
```

to pngio.c fixed the problem. Note that you may also need to set file permissions on configure and config/install-sh for the installation to work properly.

## Example

Given the page image from BHL (34565786.jpeg)

```
jbig2 -s -S -p -v -O 34565786.png 34565786.jpeg 
```

will create a smaller PNG. For darker images you may need to tweak the T parameter, e.g. use -T 100.

## Other options

Consider `opting` and `jpegoptim`, see [Optimise your pngs from the terminal in OSX](https://gist.github.com/gielcobben/64f820de086998d9f6ef).
